### getInsight Introduction
Get Insight is a series of Jupyter notebooks that allows anyone to get the latest [Mars Weather Insight API](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/) data from the [Mars Weather Service API](https://api.nasa.gov/) without applying for a NASA API key. These notebooks use the available Demo Key.

All you have to do is clone the notebooks to your local machine, and run them! They also show results right here in GitHub if you're curious. 

### Available Notebooks
So far the following notebooks are available for anyone to use:

#### grab-mars-api-no-auth
This notebook allows you to simply grab and look at the latest response from the API.

#### excel-grab-mars-insight-data-demokey
This notebook will show you the response but it will also export it to an Excel spreadsheet.
I have named the exported Excel sheet after the date, feel free to change that.
